            <p className="policy">
            We offer a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after obtaining your item to request a return.
            Please note, there is a 15% restocking charge unless you have obtained a product with faulty hardware that is verified by our team once we receive the computer back.
            <br /><br />Delivery expenses are non-reimbursable.
            <br /><br />To be qualified for a return, your&nbsp;acquisition must be in the same state that you obtained it and in its original packaging. You will also require the receipt or evidence of purchase. In the event where you do not possess the original packaging, you will be charged an additional fee for a return container. Any damages sustained in shipping due to&nbsp;non-original packaging may result in additional charges and/or denial of reimbursement.
            <br /><br />To initiate a return, you can reach out to us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:bldgtechnologics@gmail.com" target="_blank" aria-describedby="a11y-new-window-external-message" rel="noopener">bldgtechnologics@gmail.com</a>. If your return is accepted, we'll dispatch you a return shipping label, as well as instructions on how and where to send your package. Items sent back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted. 
            <br /><br />You can always contact us for any return inquiries at <a href="mailto:bldgtechnologics@gmail.com" target="_blank" aria-describedby="a11y-new-window-external-message" rel="noopener">bldgtechnologics@gmail.com</a>.

            <br />Please examine your order upon reception and contact us immediately if the item is defective, damaged or if you receive the incorrect item, so that we can evaluate the issue and rectify it.

            <strong>Exceptions / non-returnable items</strong> <br />Accessories that have been unsealed and&nbsp;exhibit signs of use and deterioration such as a keyboard, mouse, or headset cannot be returned. Please get in touch if you have questions or concerns about your particular item.&nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Reimbursements</strong> 
            <br />We will inform you once we've received and inspected your return, and let you know if the reimbursement was approved or not. If approved, you'll be automatically reimbursed on your original payment method. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the reimbursement too.
